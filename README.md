Projects and assignments written in Java and C++ while studying at The College of New Jersey. I have some projects in here from my Computer Graphics class that uses openGL. One of the projects simulates a cue ball on a pool table that you are able to hit.

A few of the projects in here were challenges that I took on in my spare time. For example, my code on Numerical Integration allows you to integrate a user-defined function choosing from three numerical integration methods. Also, my Number System Converter code allows you to convert from one number system to another. For example, you can convert from hexadecimal to binary, binary to decimal, or even base 3 to base 7, to name a few options.
